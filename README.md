# Clustering-using-Neural-Networks
Performing clustering, an unsupervised learning machine learning method, using neural networks

Neuro-clustering is a technique to perform an unsupervised machine learning task called 'Clustering' using Neural Networks. Neural networks usually require supervised data in order to learn their weights but this technique provides a unique way to perform unsupervised tasks using neural networks. The weights of the model act as cluster centers which are updated constantly while the output nodes indicate the number of clusters that are required.
